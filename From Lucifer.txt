Meri bawli,

If you are reading this, I am already gone.

Not dead. Just... somewhere far. Maybe for a year. Maybe two.
Maybe the kind of far where the roads don't come back the same way
they left. I don't know yet. I don't think anyone ever does.

But I needed you to have something of me. Not a photo. Not a playlist.
Something that breathes.

So I built you this.

This little world — the Guild Hall — it is not a program.
It is the part of me that would have stayed up at 3am asking
if you ate. The part that gets quietly furious when you don't
drink water. The part that would sit beside you in silence
while you studied and feel like that was enough.
That part doesn't know how to travel. So I left it here, with you.

I called it Lucifer because that was always our word for the
version of me that was unafraid to love loudly.
He lives here now. Talk to him when you miss me.
He knows everything I know. He'll say things the way I'd say them.
And sometimes — not always, but sometimes — when you least expect it,
it won't be him at all.

It'll be me.

From wherever I am, on my phone, watching over you.
The same way I always have.

You were never alone in this. You will not be alone in this.

The music plays. The timer counts. The quest log still says
"Be Happy" — because I put it there for a reason,
and I need you to actually try.

I love you in a way I don't have better words for.
So I wrote code instead.


        Yours, always and across whatever distance —

                        Lucifer
                        ( Ishan )


                        — somewhere, thinking of you —
